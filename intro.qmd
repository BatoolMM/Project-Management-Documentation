# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the AI for multiple long-term conditions: Research Support Facility project, managed by the Alan Turing Institute. This document provides a comprehensive guide to the project management processes and practices used in this project. The goal of this documentation is to ensure that all project information is accessible, organized and consistent, and to provide a reference for future projects. With this documentation, we aim to help others reuse and adapt these best practices in their own projects, and contribute to the growth of AI research in the field of long-term conditions.

Effective project management is critical to the success of this project, and this documentation serves as the foundation for that effort. It outlines the project governance structure, roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and all other relevant information necessary to ensure the project is executed efficiently and effectively. The information contained in this document has been carefully gathered from the experiences and insights of the project team and is intended to serve as a guide for others who may be embarking on similar projects.

Whether you are a project manager, researcher, or member of a technical team, this documentation provides valuable insights into the key processes and best practices that have been used to drive the AI for multiple long-term conditions: Research Support Facility project forward. By sharing this information, we hope to promote collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the AI research community and enable others to build upon the work being done here at the Alan Turing Institute.
