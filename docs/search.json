This document provides a comprehensive guide to the project management processes and practices used in this project. The goal of this documentation is to ensure that all project information is accessible, organized and consistent, and to provide a reference for future projects. With this documentation, we aim to help others reuse and adapt these best practices in their own projects, and contribute to the growth of AI research in the field of long-term conditions.\nEffective project management is critical to the success of this project, and this documentation serves as the foundation for that effort. It outlines the project governance structure, roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and all other relevant information necessary to ensure the project is executed efficiently and effectively. The information contained in this document has been carefully gathered from the experiences and insights of the project team and is intended to serve as a guide for others who may be embarking on similar projects.\nWhether you are a project manager, researcher, or member of a technical team, this documentation provides valuable insights into the key processes and best practices that have been used to drive the AI for multiple long-term conditions: Research Support Facility project forward. By sharing this information, we hope to promote collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the AI research community and enable others to build upon the work being done here at the Alan Turing Institute."

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide to the project management processes and practices used in this project, as well as to offer insights into the key considerations and decisions that were made along the way.\nThis book is intended to be a resource for those involved in the project, as well as for anyone interested in learning more about how to effectively manage an AI research project in the field of long-term conditions. It covers a wide range of topics, including project governance, roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, among others.\nThe information contained in this book is based on the experiences and insights of the project team and it’s a “work in progress” to provide a clear and concise overview of the key elements of the project management process. We believe that by sharing this information, we can help others to build upon the work being done here and promote collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the research community.\nWe hope that you find this book to be a valuable resource and that it helps you to better understand the intricacies of managing an AI research project. Thank you for your interest in the “AI for multiple long-term conditions: Research Support Facility” project."
