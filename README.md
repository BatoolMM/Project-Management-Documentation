## Project Management Documentation

This quarto book serves as a documentation for the project management of "[AI for multiple long-term conditions: Research Support Facility](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-multiple-long-term-conditions-research-support-facility)" project. The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide to the project management processes and practices used in this project, as well as to offer insights into the key considerations and decisions that were made along the way.

This book is intended to be a resource for those involved in the project, as well as for anyone interested in learning more about how to effectively manage an AI research project in the field of long-term conditions. It covers a wide range of topics, including project governance, roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, among others.

The information contained in this book is based on the experiences and insights of the project team and it's a "work in progress" to provide a clear and concise overview of the key elements of the project management process. We believe that by sharing this information, we can help others to build upon the work being done here and promote collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the research community.
